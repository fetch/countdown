We have added a package.json that makes this easy:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpm install -d\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will install `coffee-script` and `uglifyjs`.\r\n\r\nOnce you're configured, building the JavasScript from the command line is easy:\r\n\r\n    cake build                # build Countdown from source\r\n    cake watch                # watch coffee/ for changes and build Countdown\r\n    \r\nIf you're interested, you can find the recipes in Cakefile.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Countdown Credits\r\n\r\n- Built by [Fetch!](http://www.fetch.nl/). \r\n- Concept and development by [Koen Punt](http://koen.pt/)\r\n","tagline":"Countdown is a JavaScript plugin to easily create counters."}
